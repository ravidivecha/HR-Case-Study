## Problem Statement

# A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. 
# However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced 
# with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of 
# attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the
# company, because of the following reasons -
# 1. The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, 
#    resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
# 2. A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
# 3. More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time 
#    to acclimatise themselves to the company

# Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they 
# should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes 
# they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, 
# they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed 
# right away.

# Since you are one of the star analysts at the firm, this project has been given to you.

## Goal of the case study
# You are required to model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. 
# The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes 
# they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

# Approach followed - 
# 1. Import files and perform data cleaning and missing value inclusion
# 2. Perform logistics regression and obtain factors that influence attrition.
# 3. Find out the optimal probalility cutoff 
# 4. Obtain KS statistic
# 5. Check KS statistic in decile for optimal gain
